# LinkBridge
LinkBridge
LinkBridge is a Flutter application designed to assist people who struggle with deaf or blind disabilities by addressing the challenges faced face in daily interactions. Through combining three distinct modes of communication into one system, the tool is able to help users easily work with their disabilities and connect more deeply with the people around them. The goal is to provide flexibility in everyday life and to help everyone be a part of the conversation. By focusing on communication needs, LinkBridge serves as a reliable tool that makes daily activities more accessible and efficient.

Text-to-Audio Scanning
One key feature of LinkBridge is a camera-based system for text-to-audio scanning. This feature recognizes text on physical objects like menus, street signs, and information boards. Once the camera identifies the text, the device reads it aloud to the user. This is especially useful for people with visual impairments, since Braille is not universally available. The text-to-audio feature turns formerly blurred words into audio, enabling users to be independent in reading their surroundings at any time without needing another person’s assistance.

Automatic Captioning
Additionally, LinkBridge features automatic captioning to help users follow group conversations. This feature was inspired by a team member’s grandfather, who said he struggled to keep track of family discussions because he could not tell who was speaking. Even with hearing aids, following several voices at once in a crowded environment was a challenge. LinkBridge solves this by captioning each speaker and identifying them clearly for the user. This feature removes the guesswork and ensures that individuals with hearing loss can remain active participants in the conversation.

ASL to Text and Speech Bridge
The third component of LinkBridge is an American Sign Language (ASL) to text and speech bridge. This feature uses computer vision to track hand movements and translate them into text or audio, depending on the user’s preference. This feature was created to facilitate communication between signers and non-signers, including those who are visually impaired. By converting signs into speech, LinkBridge allows an ASL user to communicate directly with someone who may not understand ASL, bridging the communication gap between these communities.

Conclusion
Overall, LinkBridge is a versatile tool that addresses the fundamental aspects of human communication. Whether it is reading a sign, following a family dinner conversation, or connecting ASL with the hearing world, LinkBridge is there to facilitate communication. By prioritizing communication and accessibility, LinkBridge makes it easier for everyone to stay connected and engaged with the world around them.
